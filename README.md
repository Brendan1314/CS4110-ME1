# Reaction paper to Alan Turing’s “Computing Machinery and Intelligence” (1950).

As what I've learned is that Turing’s ideas were groundbreaking because they opened up new ways to view intelligence, not as an exclusive trait of humans but as something that could be replicated in machines. I agree with his pragmatic approach to measuring intelligence by behavior, but I also see the limitations of the Turing Test in capturing the full scope of intelligence. Intelligence isn't just about replicating human conversation—it's also about perception, creativity, and emotion, which the Turing Test doesn't fully address.

It’s also fascinating to see how Turing foresaw the development of learning machines, an area that has grown tremendously since his time. However, even with advancements in machine learning and AI, we’re still grappling with the complexities of human intelligence and what it means for a machine to truly understand.

His study laid the foundation for AI, and while some aspects of his vision have evolved with new technology, Turing's ideas continue to influence the way we think about intelligence and the possibilities of human-machine interaction. His work inspires us to keep questioning and exploring the boundaries of thought and technology.
